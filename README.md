# Study Timer

This is a work-in-progress mainly for my own study of law at <https://nwculaw.edu>. Hopefully it will be useful to others as well, once I get it working.

# Goals

* nag every .1 hour to see if I'm still studying
* save study time per course per week
* play audio files associated with study courses and keep track of time
